# Portable-Water-Quality-Detection
A machine learning model capable of analyzing real-time  sensor data to detect water contaminants. - Implement a system to provide early warnings to relevant authorities  and the public. - Ensure the model is accurate, reliable, and can operate in diverse  environmental conditions. 
The whole model has been made using IBM AI Watson, available in IBM Cloud and has also been deployed using the IBM Cloud which can further we used by using API for further projects too.
